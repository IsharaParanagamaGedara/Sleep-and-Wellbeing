# 😴 Sleep & Wellbeing 🌙

## Project Overview

This project explores the intricate relationships between sleep patterns, lifestyle choices, and cardiovascular health. Utilizing the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, we aim to uncover insights that can inform better health decisions and interventions.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset** is a comprehensive collection of data on sleep patterns 😴, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular health ❤️ for 400 individuals. The dataset comprises 13 key variables, categorized as follows:

### **1. Demographics:** 👤
- **Person ID:** Unique identifier for each individual.
- **Gender:** ♿ (Male/Female)
- **Age:** 📅 (Years)
- **Occupation:** 💼 (e.g., Software Engineer, Doctor, Teacher)
- **BMI Category:** 📏 (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

### **2. Cardiovascular Health:** ❤️
- **Blood Pressure:** 🌡️ (Systolic/Diastolic)
- **Heart Rate:** 💓 (Beats per minute)

### **3. Lifestyle:** 🏃‍♀️
- **Physical Activity Level:** ⏱️ (Minutes per day)
- **Stress Level:** 😟 (Scale of 1 to 10)
- **Daily Steps:** 🛆 (Number of steps)

### **4. Sleep-Related Factors:** 💤
- **Sleep Duration:** ⏰ (Hours per day)
- **Quality of Sleep:** ⭐ (Scale of 1 to 10)

### **5. Sleep Disorder:** 🫅 (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea) - Target Variable

## 🎯 Dataset Objectives

The primary goal of this dataset is to understand the complex interplay between sleep patterns 😴, lifestyle choices, and cardiovascular health ❤️. This dataset can be used to:

- **Investigate the association between sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea) 🫅 and cardiovascular health indicators**, including blood pressure 🌡️ and heart rate 💓.
- **Explore the impact of lifestyle factors (physical activity 🏃‍♀️, stress 😟) on sleep duration ⏰ and quality ⭐.**
- **Analyze the relationship between sleep duration ⏰, sleep quality ⭐, and blood pressure 🌡️ across different demographic groups** (age 📅, gender ♿, BMI 📏).
- **Identify potential risk factors ⚠️ for sleep disorders and associated cardiovascular health issues.**
- **Develop predictive models** ⚙ to classify and estimate the risk of sleep disorders (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea) based on lifestyle, cardiovascular health, and demographic factors.
- **Analyze the contribution** of key features 🏆 (e.g., BMI, Age, Occupation, Blood Pressure) to sleep disorder risk using SHAP and other interpretability techniques.

## 📈 Model Training & Evaluation

To develop robust predictive models, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms:

### **Models Used:**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **LGBM Classifier**
- **CatBoost Classifier**

### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Accuracy Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**
- **Classification Report**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## 📊 Conclusion

This project highlights the critical relationships between sleep, lifestyle, and cardiovascular health. The insights gained can help individuals and healthcare professionals make informed decisions to improve sleep quality and overall well-being.
